# Publishing the API from your TCI Application
Post completion of Shipment Waiver application, we can now expose this as an API. In other words, we will now push our Flogo App (created from the API Specification) to 'API Management' which will provide secure access to your API.
 
## Publishing the Flogo App into API Layer
Go to the Apps list and identify the app that is running, the endpoint of which needs to be published to the API Gateway ‘API Management’.
From the Flogo App, traverse to the ‘Endpoints’ and click on the Publish to Mashery button as shown below:

Under the Traffic Manager Domain drop-down, select the *eval****** traffic manager that has been created for your trial and click Next:

**Note: It is important to choose the correct trial instance which is 'eval....' for this workshop**

Next, click on New Definition.
Name it ‘shipmentWaiver’ and click Create: This will create an API Definition for us.

Now Click on shipmentWaiverAPI definition that just got created:
<img src="/images/apigate/4.png" alt="manageapp" width=700/>

The ‘/shipmentwaiver’ operation is automatically selected (because this was the only operation we defined in the API Spec and which was subsequently implemented in the microservice).
Click Next:

API’s are provided through Packages which contain 1 or more plans. The Package will define what APIs are available to developers. The Plan will define the access they have to the APIs, for example, the number of calls per second.
We will now create both a package and a plan.
First let's create our package by clicking  ‘Create a package’ as shown below and name it “BasicPackage”

Next, we will add a plan as shown. Name it as “StandardPlan”. Ensure the Allow self-provisioning keys box is checked and click Create
<img src="/images/apigate/7.png" alt="manageapp" width=700/>

Select the ‘StandardPlan’ and click Publish as shown below:
<img src="/images/apigate/8.png" alt="manageapp" width=700/>

Once the API has been published, a message similar to below will be shown:
<img src="/images/apigate/9.png" alt="manageapp" width=700/>

click Done.
