# Why do we need TIBCO API Management?

The purpose of pushing the application and adding API Endpoint to an API Management gateway is to collate and expose them as Catalogs. TIBCO has helped many customers achieve this around the globe.

For example, here is a screenshot of Macy's API Catalog built using TIBCO API Management.
You can checkout the portal at ‘developer.macys.com’

## What is different about TIBCO API Management?

TIBCO API Management scales at more than 2.6 BILLION calls per day servicing customers like Macy’s, NewsCorp Australia, and many more.

TIBCO API Management's platform offers customers the agility to switch between their cloud providers, use multiple cloud providers, or choose a hybrid cloud architecture to better manage their egress charges (as opposed to being tied to a particular cloud provider's API Gateway). This flexibility and cost savings is a great advantage to many of our customers.

## Ways to bring the API endpoint into API Management
There are multiple ways an API endpoint can be brought into API Management.

1. By directly publishing from the cloud Integration with a single click as discussed in the previous section
2. By Importing (a file or URI)
3. By creating it manually

## Working with the API Management Control Center
Following steps summarize the configuration required for the API Management tool (Mashery) to secure properly and exposed over the Gateway.

Some of those steps are :
- Defining the API and configuring the endpoint(s)
- Applying Security layers
- Package related configurations on the API definition
- Plan(s) inside a package for the API Definition
- Testing the endpoint for user consumption

API Management provides these options shown in the Dashboard below, to properly secure, define, configure and expose the endpoint of your application.
