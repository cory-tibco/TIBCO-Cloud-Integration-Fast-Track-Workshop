# API Implementation and Reuse

TIBCO Cloud Integration allows an organization to easily implement with API-Led development practices (following the Gartner Bi-Modal architecture principle).  

For implementing the API spec lets start with a connection creation needed for the app. Navigate to "Integration Apps" from the menu as below:

## Creating a connection to CRM DB
Let's create a Connection to develop our integration app.

**Your TIBCO workshop facilitator should provide you with the Database connection details needed for this step.**  

*Note: A sample of the database connection parameters are available in the downloaded git repository, at the location: /TIBCO-Cloud-Integration-Virtual-Workshop/labfiles/flogoapp/crmdbconnection.md*

From the Menu, Choose Connections, then click the Create button to the right and search for "mysql":

Click on the mysql connector and enter the details given by your TIBCO workshop facilitator. Then click the Connect button:

A connection will be successfully added as below:

## Creating an App (A Microservice)

With the API Specification created and mocked-up, we are ready to build the actual service based on the specification.

For this workshop, we will use **'Flogo'**, a lightweight integration tool available in TCI, to build a microservice from the API Spec.

**Navigate to Flogo capability as shown below:**

Switch to "Apps" from the menu > click "Create/Import" button > Select Flogo > "Create New App"

<img src="/images/apiimp/4.png" alt="APIIMP" width=700/>

Change the name to "ShipmentWaiverApp" and click Create

### Using API Spec to create a "Post Method" flow in your app

On the next page "Add triggers and flows" select "API Specification" and select "Shipment Waiver" specification >> click "Create"

<img src="/images/apiimp/6.png" alt="APIIMP" width=700/>

Wait a few seconds. As illustrated below, TCI automatically created a flow for the POST method you designed. We can now configure this flow and add additional steps as required.
Click on the flow to edit it:

Notice that a trigger and some activities have been created for you:

### How to map fields and add activities in a Flogo App

**This is also referred to as 'Orchestrating and Transforming' the microservice flow**

We will now need to map the inputs to the outputs.  First click on the trigger, change the port number, and save.
<img src="/images/apiimp/9.png" alt="APIIMP" width=700/>

We will map the following on Map to Flow Inputs: Note you can simply click on the elements or type them out as shown below and Save

<img src="/images/apiimp/10.png" alt="APIIMP" width=700/>


Lastly we will map the following to Map to Flow Outputs. Note you can simply click on the elements or type them out as shown below and Save.

<img src="/images/apiimp/11.png" alt="APIIMP" width=700/>

You can use a simple click and drag to move the activities within the flow. This will allow you to add new activities in order to build a complete end-to-end process. For this workshop we will be calling an existing RESTful API to get a new transaction ID, extract customer and product information, log a message into the application log, and implement the response sent back to the user.


### Adding a FetchCustomerDetails Activity  

Now, letâ€™s start configuring the process API to achieve an orchestration of services.

Drag and drop each activity card a few places to the right as illustrated below :
<img src="/images/apiimp/12.png" alt="APIIMP" width=700/>

Note: Everything you do here is automatically saved.

Then click the first box on the flow line to add a new activity.

<img src="/images/apiimp/12_1.png" alt="screenshot of add activity box" width=700/>

Search for "mysql" and select the MySQL Query activity. 

<img src="/images/apiimp/13_1.png" alt="screenshot of mysql activity search" width=700/>

Rename this new activity as FetchCustomerDetails by clicking on the pencil icon. Next, under settings choose the connection we created earlier and save it:

<img src="/images/apiimp/13.png" alt="add MySQL" width=700/>

Click on the input settings and copy/paste the below sql statement:

`
select * from customer_details where Email=?;
`

<img src="/images/apiimp/14.png" alt="APIIMP" width=700/>

Next, click on the input menu and create the mapping as shown below.  To do so, just drill down to the parameters you want to map and then drag and drop one over the other.  Finish by clicking save.
<img src="/images/apiimp/15.png" alt="APIIMP" width=700/>

Your "FetchCustomerDetails" activity is now completely configured.

We will also add a "Log Message" activity to log the output of FetchCustomerDetails. Click on the next 'add activity' box in the flow, search for "log", and select the "LogMessage" activity.  From the input menu use the available data section to drill down to FirstName. Then, drag and drop it over the message box in the activity input area.  You will need to insert a 0 for the records array index.  Alternatively you can just click the message and copy/paste the below text.

`
$activity[FetchCustomerDetails].Output.records[0].FirstName
`

<img src="/images/apiimp/16.png" alt="Create App" width=700/>

The remaining activities for the Process App can be built the same way.
When we are finished, the completed process orchestration will look similar to the one below.

However, don't worry, we have a pre-built application that has all these steps completed which you will import later in this workshop.
