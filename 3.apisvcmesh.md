# Service discovery using TIBCO Cloud Mesh

TIBCO Cloud Mesh allows an organization to connect to available services with a simple visual discovery including search and sort capabilities. In other words it simply enables you to present a REST service you have implemented, for others to use.
*Think of reusability with a self-service option in an automated way!*

For implementing the cloud mesh lets start by importing a ready-made flow.

## Importing an app for implementing via TIBCO cloud mesh

From your apps page click the **"Create/Import"** button > Select flogo  > Create New App

In the next screen click "Import app" and then "browse to upload"

Select the file "createleadinMarketo" needed from your github downloaded project as shown below and click upload, followed by "Import all" in the displayed dialog box. *You can ignore the errors/warnings in the dialog box.

After few seconds the app will be successfully imported and is ready to be pushed(deployed) and consumed internally within organization.

## Deploying and publishing the app to cloud Mesh

First, click the draft button to turn the app live.

Next, rename the flow and click "Push"to get it deployed.

After a few seconds it will get deployed but will be in a stopped state , and have to be scaled to 1 instance. Click on the upward arrow and click scale and allow a few seconds for it to spin up.

Once Running click the "Apps" menu and find the app imported and click on "set endpoint visibility" .

In the next pop-up screen click "update". This would allow the app to be discovered via cloud mesh as a reusable shared service.

That's how easy it is for any service to be discoverable in the cloud mesh.  
Now we can wire this service to our app.
**However, before we do that, let's also import a low-code business app**

Low-Code business apps are created using another capability **within TCI**, known as **'LiveApps'** found inside ***'Low Code Apps & Processes'***.

We will import this pre-built business app as part of the shipment waiver project.
