# Explore the unified view to manage your apps.

### Managing Apps

In this section we are going to take a quick look at TIBCO's Unified View .
TCI provides an intuitive UI for you to ensure efficient operations of your deployed apps so that you can address errors in a timely and informed way.

CLick the apps tab and if the dashboard is not showing click Show Dashboard.

You will get a consolidated list of all your Integration Apps across the organization .

With a single click , you can list your application performance and statuses such as "Number of executions" completion and errors as well as any CPU and memory usage over last 24 hour time-period

With another click on "View app details" on the same page >> and then Monitoring tab to explore performance details  and runtime errors.

Click on sub-menu "flows" to find execution logs capturing data at the activity level. You will get insights on completed and faulted counts per activity.
On the right you can also check average execution times for each activities. You would leverage this to troubleshoot any delays .

For further troubleshooting delays(Consider increased demands) you would need to check Resource metrics to find Visual graphs showing a periodic trace on cpu & memory usages for the instance(s).

Finally you can also check the logs menu and use different filters to load and observe the logs for instance executions on your app.

That's it. You have explored quickly on how to manage your Apps , Nice & easy.

Let's take a look at how can we expose the App end-point to an API Gateway. Understanding how a microservice with an API Endpoint can be exposed to an API Management layer completes the entire lifecycle of an API Led Development.
In many organizations, the API Management is usually undertaken by a separate team whose functions include securing the endpoint access as well as monitoring the activities on the platform.

### Note: The next step (of Exposing the URL to an API Gateway) is an optional step for participants using one of the below regions
